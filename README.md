## Pgrubic

Pgrubic is a PostgreSQL linter and formatter for schema migrations and design best practices.

## Features
- Over 100+ rules.
- Automatic violation correction (e.g., automatically add `concurrently` to index create statements).
- River style code formatting.

## Getting Started
For more, see the [documentation](https://bolajiwahab.github.io/pgrubic/).

## Installation
```bash
pip install pgrubic
```
**<span style="color:red">Pgrubic is only supported on Python 3.12+</span>**.

## Usage
For linting, try any of the following:
```bash
pgrubic lint                         # Lint SQL files in the current directory (and any subdirectories)
pgrubic lint .                       # Lint SQL files in the current directory (and any subdirectories)
pgrubic lint directory               # Lint SQL files in *directory* (and any subdirectories)
pgrubic lint directory/*.sql         # Lint SQL files in *directory*
pgrubic lint directory/file.sql      # Lint `file.sql` in *directory*
pgrubic lint file.sql                # Lint `file.sql`
pgrubic lint directory/*.sql --fix   # Lint SQL files in *directory* and fix violations automatically
pgrubic lint file.sql --fix          # Lint `file.sql` and fix violations automatically
```
Sample output from linting:
```bash
pgrubic lint *.sql

file.sql:1:38: TP017: Boolean field should be not be nullable

1 | ALTER TABLE public.example ADD COLUMN foo boolean DEFAULT false;
```

```bash
pgrubic file.sql

test.sql:1:38: TP017: Boolean field should be not be nullable

1 | ALTER TABLE public.example ADD COLUMN foo boolean DEFAULT false;
```

For formatting, try any of the following:
```bash
pgrubic format                         # Format SQL files in the current directory (and any subdirectories)
pgrubic format .                       # Format SQL files in the current directory (and any subdirectories)
pgrubic format directory               # Format SQL files in *directory* (and any subdirectories)
pgrubic format directory/*.sql         # Format SQL files in *directory*
pgrubic format directory/file.sql      # Format `file.sql` in *directory*
pgrubic format file.sql                # Format `file.sql`
pgrubic format directory/*.sql --check # Check if SQL files would have been modified, returning a non-zero exit code
pgrubic format file.sql --diff         # Report if `file.sql` would have been modified, returning a non-zero exit code as well the difference between `file.sql` and how the formatted file would look like
```

Pgrubic can also be used as a pre-commit hook:
```
- repo: https://github.com/bolajiwahab/pgrubic
  rev: v1.0.0
  hooks:
    - id: pgrubic-lint
    - id: pgrubic-format
```
## Configuration
Pgrubic can be configured via the [`pgrubic.toml`] file in either the current directory or in the user's home directory.
The following configuration options are available in the [`pgrubic.toml`] with the following defaults:
```
[lint]
# Enable all rules by default
select = []

# Disable no rules by default
ignore = []

# Include all files by default
include = []

# Exclude no files by default
exclude = []

# Ignore suppressing violations that are marked as `noqa` by default
ignore-noqa = false

# Disallowed schemas
disallowed-schemas = []

# Allowed extensions
allowed-extensions = []

# Allowed languages
allowed-languages = []

# Do not fix violations automatically
fix = false

# Disallowed data types
disallowed-data-types = []

# Required columns
required-columns = []

# Suffix Timestamp columns with `_at` by default
timestamp-column-suffix = "_at"

# Suffix Date columns with suffix `_date` by default
date-column-suffix = "_date"

# Allow nay naming convention for partitions by default
regex-partition = "^.+$"

# Allow all any naming convention for indexes by default
regex-index = "^.+$"

# Allow any naming convention for primary key constraints by default
regex-constraint-primary-key = "^.+$"

# ALlow any naming convention for unique keys by default
regex-constraint-unique-key = "^.+$"

# Allow any naming convention for foreign keys by default
regex-constraint-foreign-key = "^.+$"

# Allow any naming convention for check constraints by default
regex-constraint-check = "^.+$"

# Allow any naming convention for exclusion constraints by default
regex-constraint-exclusion = "^.+$"

# Allow any naming convention for sequences by default
regex-sequence = "^.+$"

[format]
# Include all files by default
include = []

# Exclude no files by default
exclude = []

# Comma at the beginning of an item by default
comma-at-beginning = true

# Semicolon after last statement by default
semicolon-after-last-statement = true

# Remove pg_catalog from functions by default
remove-pg-catalog-from-functions = true

# Separate statements by a certain number by of new line, 1 by default
lines-between-statements = 1

# Check if SQL files would have been modified, returning a non-zero exit code
check = false

# Report if SQL files would have been modified, returning a non-zero exit code as well the difference between the current file and how the formatted file would look like
diff = false
```

Some configuration options can be supplied via CLI arguments such as `--check`, `--diff`, `--fix`.
```bash
pgrubic format --check
```
```bash
pgrubic format --diff
```
```bash
pgrubic lint --fix
```
